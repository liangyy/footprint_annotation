Currently this module only works for paired end data.

Memo:

FastQC can be done via

```
module load fastqc
fastqc seq1 seq2
```

You may need phred encoding to run trim step correctly.
To determine Phred, use fastQC result.
See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding) for more information.
